										At age 34, I had a hysterectomy for
										<span class="yshortcuts">cervical cancer</span>. 
										In my early 40s, I had surgery to remove
										<span class="yshortcuts">an 
										endometriosis</span> mass and had both 
										of my ovaries removed. After this second 
										surgery, I was put on HRT because it was
										<i>assumed</i> that since I had no 
										ovaries I needed it. The 
										endometrial mass started to return, so I 
										was taken off the HRT and given 
										Lupron shots once monthly for 3 months 
										to deplete my body of all hormones (I 
										guess to wipe the slate clean) </span>
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
										¨C </span>
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										idea 
										being the mass would not return. I had&nbsp;<span class="yshortcuts">extreme 
										weight gain,</span> and I was diagnosed 
										with depression not long after and 
										prescribed Zoloft for the symptoms. I 
										had also been&nbsp;on
										<span class="yshortcuts">high blood 
										pressure medication</span> for 10 
										years,&nbsp;and very recently my MD also 
										wanted&nbsp;me to start taking&nbsp;<span class="yshortcuts">high 
										cholesterol medication</span> which I 
										absolutely refused, as somewhere in my 
										mind it just didn't make sense.</span></p>
										<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										On a separate note, one of my dogs, the&nbsp;Rottweiler,&nbsp;had 
										been having health problems costing me 
										well over $3,000 in less than 6 months 
										for medication alone. For&nbsp;6 months,&nbsp;she 
										was continuously prescribed Flagyl, 
										antibiotics,&nbsp;something for nausea and 
										something else for diarrhea, etc. 
										When the course of medications (that, by 
										the way, weren't helping her) was 
										discontinued, not only did the symptoms 
										resume, but worse. Bloody diarrhea 
										turned to blood only, her blood platelet 
										count got so low that she should have 
										died. So then it was recommended that I 
										give her&nbsp;a course of heavy duty steroids 
										which, after a couple of weeks, she had 
										to be weaned off as it was too 
										dangerously high a dosage to stop 
										suddenly - oh and by the way, something 
										for her stomach&nbsp;to aid in digestion 
										while she was on the steroids.</span></p>
										<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										I think it was&nbsp;spring of this year that 
										I was referred to Dr. Vagias for a 
										naturopathic consultation. What a 
										Godsend! Because of her educating 
										me,&nbsp;her guidance and genuine 
										concern&nbsp;about my health:&nbsp;1) I do not need 
										blood pressure medication anymore, 2)&nbsp;I am 
										still taking a small dosage of Zoloft, 
										but now I&nbsp;am&nbsp;much more mentally 
										balanced,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">and </span>
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										3) I definitely do not need 
										to take cholesterol medication. Other 
										benefits I've noticed are my 
										skin&nbsp;is much less dry (I don't need to 
										use as much lotion daily and it has a 
										glow to it), the osteoarthritis joints in 
										my hands are less noticeable, I sleep 
										better,&nbsp;have more energy, my alcohol 
										consumption is&nbsp;less, and I&nbsp;have&nbsp;lost 
										weight and am still losing. I feel 
										better inside myself (best way I can 
										describe the other benefit).</span></p>
										<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										She also made recommendations to help my 
										dog¡¯s health get back into balance. My 
										dog&nbsp;is now also enjoying the best of 
										health at 10 years old! She has not 
										needed to go the vet to get her glands 
										squeezed, whereas she used to need to go 
										monthly, no more&nbsp;crying out because of
										<span class="yshortcuts">joint pain</span>, 
										no more diarrhea and vomiting (no more
										<span class="yshortcuts">bloody stools</span>), 
										no more &quot;walking pooping.&quot; And bonus 
										-&nbsp;hardly any garbage eating on her 
										walks.</span></p>

										I went to Dr. Vagias to address some 
										serious health issues my two children 
										had, which the pediatricians had 
										dismissed as ¡°normal.&quot; My daughter is 4 
										years old and had bowel movements every 
										12 days on average and had a very itchy 
										skin rash. My son, 7 years old, had 
										severe stomach pains after eating his 
										lunch. Often, the pain was so intense 
										they would send him home from school. He 
										was throwing up often and would feel 
										nauseous after eating. </span></p>
										<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										I have incorporated Dr. Vagias¡¯ dietary 
										recommendations into my children¡¯s lives 
										for several weeks now. My daughter has 
										loved the changes from the start. She 
										says the food tastes so good! My son 
										grew to like the foods but only after a 
										few days. He now thinks food items such 
										as store bought milk are sour and has no 
										interest in them. </span></p>
										<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										I'm very proud of both of the kids 
										because they are both interested in 
										learning how to get healthier, and they 
										want to know what to do to achieve good 
										health.&nbsp;They are always asking if what 
										they want to eat is something good for 
										them. Many times I have to tell them, no 
										it's not, but they are learning.&nbsp;My 
										daughter has always had a sweet tooth, 
										but she is willing to give it up most of 
										the time now if it means she will get 
										better.</span></p>
										<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
										My son has been doing much better. He 
										hasn't been sick since starting on the 
										dietary changes. He doesn't take as long 
										as he used to in the bathroom with his
										<span class="yshortcuts">bowel movements</span> 
										and hasn't complained of headaches or 
										stomach aches!</span></p>

										In 1998, I was diagnosed with severe 
										allergies to food (corn protein), 
										environmental and dust mite allergies. 
										Doctors advised me to take Zyrtec or 
										Claritin on a daily basis to control 
										this situation. If I did not take any 
										pill for 48 hours I did suffer ¨C to the 
										point of getting migraines, sinus 
										infections etc ¡­ So I have taken Zyrtec 
										daily for almost 10 years. In the past, 
										I also suffered from depression related 
										to my breast cancer diagnosis and 
										treatment. I could not focus sometimes.&nbsp;
										</span></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
										When I decided to consult Dr. Demetra 
										Vagias, I started a new chapter of my 
										life. Dr. Vagias prescribed special diet 
										and natural remedies (food supplements) 
										over the medical options. The diet 
										helped and food supplements supported 
										control of my allergies, perhaps to the 
										point of elimination. The thought of 
										going with the medical options horrified 
										me, and so I tried to follow a natural 
										path recommended by Dr Vagias.</span></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
										After being under Dr Vagias¡¯ wing for a 
										few months, my allergies are now under 
										control, I lost weight, and can focus 
										with more energetic attitude.&nbsp; Being 
										able to use natural remedies over 
										medicine has been exciting for me as I 
										know how damaging taking the medical 
										path can be; whereas natural remedies 
										work in conjunction with your body.&nbsp;
										</span></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
										Dr. Vagias has also helped my son 
										(25-year-old suffering from foot 
										fungus). As an added bonus, my son lost 
										17 lbs. and now looks very healthy and 
										has glowing skin. She has also helped my 
										14-year-old dog and sweetheart. My dog 
										has been blind for a year, and now she 
										decided to stop eating the standard pet 
										food (dry form). After consulting with 
										Dr. Vagias, we applied a natural form of 
										food and supplement, and my dog now 
										feels and acts like a puppy.</span></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
										Dr. Vagias is an excellent doctor. I am 
										completely content with her care of my 
										medical condition. She is very 
										knowledgeable, kind and caring. I can 
										reach her very quickly 24 hours a day, 
										and I do not abuse this privilege.
