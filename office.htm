										<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>New 
										Patient Appointments<br>
										</b>Please allow approximately 1 ½ hours 
										for this appointment. During your first 
										visit we will be conducting a detailed 
										consultation and evaluation of your 
										health concerns.&nbsp;Because of the length 
										of time we have reserved for you, please 
										call the office at least 48 hours in 
										advance to reschedule or cancel an 
										appointment.&nbsp;This will enable another 
										patient to be seen.&nbsp;We charge a 
										new patient missed appointment fee of $75. 
										We require a credit/debit 
										card that we keep on file in order to secure your 
										appointment time. </font></p>

										<font face="Arial" size="2">Follow Up 
										Appointments<br>
										</font></b>
										<font face="Arial" size="2">Follow up 
										appointments are scheduled in 3-8 week 
										intervals (at our professional 
										discretion).&nbsp;This is the time to 
										discuss the initial recommendations, 
										protocol and make any changes if 
										necessary. The visit process (e.g., the 
										first initial visit and follow up visit) 
										is the best way to get you on track with 
										your protocol and to make a 
										real difference in your health.</font></p>
								<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Missed 
										Appointments<br>
										</b>It is understandable if life 
										circumstances cause you to reschedule 
										your appointment. Please cancel or 
										reschedule your appointments 48 hours 
										prior to your scheduled time. We 
										do not double book. As your 
										appointment time is set aside 
										specifically to focus on your individual 
										needs, it impacts our office if 
										cancellations occur in less than 48 
										hours. One missed appointment is 
										understandable in emergency situations, 
										but more that one missed follow up appointments 
										will assume a $35 missed appointment fee. With 
										repeatedly missed appointments, it may be 
										difficult for us to continue care. 
										NOTE: If you arrive more that 10 minutes 
										after your scheduled appointment time, 
										it may be necessary to reschedule, or 
										your visit time will be shortened 
										accordingly. Please call us if you 
										are running late.</font></p>

										Nutritional Supplements<br>
										</b>Nutritional supplements can be 
										refilled by calling our office prior to 
										pick up or can be shipped directly with a 
										credit card payment. Please allow 3-5 
										business days from the time you order to 
										the time you receive them.&nbsp;There is no 
										need for an office visit to refill 
										nutritional supplements.</font></p>
								<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<font face="Arial" size="2">Supplements cannot be returned after 7 
										days of purchase date. Only unopened 
										supplements will be refunded at full 
										price.&nbsp;Unfortunately, opened 
										supplements cannot be returned.</font></p>
								<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>
										Telephone Consults<br>
										</b>Telephone consults will be billed at 
										a rate of $150 for a 30-minute session. 
										This applies to follow up visits only. 
										We do not conduct initial consultations 
										over the phone.</font></p>
								<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt" align="left">
										<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Phone 
										Calls<br>
										</b>Due to increasing patient volume, we 
										are finding it difficult to address the 
										volume of phone calls we are receiving. 
										Phone calls pertaining directly to your 
										recent visit which require 1-2 minutes 
										will be answered.&nbsp;Please understand 
										that often the schedule is full and 
										non-emergency calls may not be returned 
										until after 5:30 p.m. or the following 
										day. <b><i>More complex discussions will 
										require a follow up appointment. If 
										needed, a phone consult can be scheduled 
										and will be billed at the rate of $75 
										per 15 minutes. Please be sure to 
										schedule an office visit or a phone 
										consultation.</i></b></font></p>

										<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Insurance Forms<br>
										</b>We are non participating providers 
										for all insurance companies.&nbsp;We do not 
										bill Medicare or any other insurance 
										company.&nbsp;We do not handle requests or 
										inquiries from insurance companies.</font></p>
