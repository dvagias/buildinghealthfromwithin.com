										Naturopathic medicine</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
										(also known as <b>naturopathy</b> or <b>
										natural medicine</b>) is a complementary 
										and alternative medicine which 
										emphasizes the ability of the body to 
										heal and maintain itself, which 
										practitioners believe is innate. 
										Naturopathic practice may include 
										different modalities such as abstinence, 
										acupuncture, colonic irrigation, 
										counseling, chiropractic, diet, 
										exercise, herbalism, homeopathy, 
										hydrotherapy, environmental medicine, 
										manual therapy, orthomolecular medicine 
										and relaxation. Practitioners emphasize 
										a holistic approach to patient care, and 
										may recommend patients use conventional 
										medicine alongside their treatments. 
										Naturopathy has its origins in the 
										Nature Cure movement of Europe. It is 
										practiced in many countries, but subject 
										to different standards of regulation and 
										levels of acceptance.</span></p>
										<p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-left: 3.75pt">
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
										Naturopathic practitioners prefer not to 
										use invasive surgery or most synthetic 
										drugs, preferring natural remedies, for 
										instance, relatively unprocessed or whole 
										medications such as herbs and foods. 
										Graduates of a naturopathic medical 
										school in North America are trained to 
										use diagnostic tests such as imaging and 
										blood tests before deciding upon the 
										full course of treatment. In some 
										states, naturopathic doctors who hold an 
										ND are licensed to prescribe 
										pharmaceutical medicines and perform 
										minor surgeries.</span></p>

										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
										Naturopathic physicians in North America 
										are primary care providers trained in 
										conventional medical sciences, diagnosis 
										and treatment and are experts in 
										natural therapeutics. Licensing and 
										training requirements vary from state to 
										state, but at least 15 states, the 
										District of Columbia, and four Canadian 
										provinces have formal licensing and 
										educational requirements. In these 
										jurisdictions, naturopathic physicians 
										must pass comprehensive board exams set 
										by the North American Board of 
										Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) after 
										having completed academic and clinical 
										training at a college certified by the 
										Council on Naturopathic Medical 
										Education (CNME). The letters ND usually 
										designate a naturopathic doctor or 
										physician in jurisdictions where such a 
										title is protected by law.</span></p>

										Traditional naturopaths<br>
										</span></span>
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
										Traditional naturopaths are guided by 
										the same naturopathic philosophies and 
										principles as board-licensed 
										naturopathic physicians and often 
										prescribe similar treatments, but do so 
										as alternative or complimentary 
										practitioners rather than as primary 
										care providers. Some may voluntarily 
										join a professional organization, but 
										these organizations do not accredit 
										educational programs in any meaningful 
										way or license practitioners per se. The 
										training programs for traditional 
										naturopaths can vary greatly, are less 
										rigorous and do not provide the same 
										basic and clinical science education as 
										naturopathic medical schools do. The 
										professional organizations formed by 
										traditional naturopaths are not 
										recognized by the U.S. government or any 
										U.S. state or territory.</span></p>

										Naturopathic physicians follow three

										1.
										The use of methods and medicinal 
										substances which minimize the risk of 
										harmful side effects.<br>
										2.
										To avoid, when possible, the harmful
